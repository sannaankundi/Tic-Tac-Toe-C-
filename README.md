# Fast Explanation

This is a normal Tic-Tac-Toe game created using C++.

I built it when I was learning C++

I tried to add a graphical interface to it.

Options were SFML or QT.

Tried QT but there was an internet problem.

SFML was a pain in the ass. It wasn't working. There were around 19 errors I didn't understand a thing about.

So, I just left it like this.

Anyways, it's easy to understand... just run it.
